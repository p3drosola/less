##### Does it have X feature?

No. Less Mail is not supposed to do everything, or work for every use case. It's not a replacement for a full-featured email client. It just supports the actions I find myself doing 90% of the time. When I need feature X I just open gmail.


##### Do you support other email services other than Gmail?
I'm afraid not at the moment. [Leave me you email]() if you're interested, and I'll let you know when it's ready.

##### Do you support browsers other than Chrome?
I feel bad saying this, but it's basically the same answer as above.

##### How are the avatars calculated?

They are based on the MD5 hash of the sender's email. They are supposed to serve as a semi-subconcious visual indicator. You can change a persons avatar by double clicking on thew avatar while in the message detail view.


##### Why is it so 'flat'?

I'm glad you asked.

> Because fuck you. That's why.
